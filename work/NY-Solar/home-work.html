			<h1>Plug Into Solar Power</h1>
			<h2>Solar Power Make Business Sense</h2>
			<p>There are many reasons for businesses to use solar power. Solar power can reduce or eliminate a building’s electric bill. The systems have long term reliability and low maintenance costs, often lasting 25–40 years with little or no maintenance. It’s also good for the environment. So you help the planet, and being a “green” business today also makes your business more attractive to consumers.</p>
			<h2>Solar Power Your Home for Less Then You Think</h2>
			<p>With government tax rebates and incentives you’d be surprised at how affordable it is to install a modern solar power electric system for your home. You can even make your utility meter spin backwards. When your solar power system generates more electricity than you consume, your meter actually spins backwards, earning you credit with your utility company at the same rate they are charging you. You could drive your electric bill to zero! At today’s prices that can be a huge savings, quickly paying for the solar power system.</p>
			<h2>Solar Power for the Masses</h2>
			<p>We work with local, state and federal governments to design, build and maintain solar power systems. Whatever the project, NY Solar can help.</p>

			<h1>Solar Power Makes For A Happy Planet</h1>
			<h2>Enabling Businesses and Home Owners To Use Solar Power</h2>
			<p>Solar power is a clean, renewable and cost effective power solution. We help business owners, home owners, and government to design and install standard or custom solar power systems that meet their needs and budget.</p>
			<h2> Serving All of New York State, and Now Serving New Jersey!</h2>
			<p>We started off wanting to bring solar energy to people in New York. Now that we’ve become successful in delivering solar power solutions we are expanding. We just started offering installations in New Jersey. When possible we hope to expand service to other Northeastern states, and maybe some day the entire nation. Someday we envision a totally solar powered U.S.A. and world. We want to help make that happen.</p>

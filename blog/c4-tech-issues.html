    <h1>Net Neutrality</h1>
    <h2>and where we could end up without it</h2>
    <h4>2.5.2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>The explosion of new technology in the internet age is for the most part thanks to net neutrality. All information is treated equally and is accessible to everyone for the same cost. Sadly, big business and some government officials are trying to change that.</p>

<p>An example of this is the deals made between Comcast and Xbox, and Comcast and Netflix. Netflix and Xbox both struck deals where they would pay Comcast a premium for faster connection speeds and improved overall performance for their customers. Unless "Net Neutrality" is passed into law, deals like these could spiral out of control. Soon, the major internet providers could charge every single online business a premium monthly fee just so they can increase their site's speed and performace, which is something that should be afforded to them for free. Sure, established online business would be fine, but it will be much harder for startups to get off the ground if they don't have the capitol to move into the provider's higher speed tier. Without net neutrality, the internet providers can block p2p sharing, and any website they choose. So larger companies will have an internet "fast lane," while everyone else is left in the dust. Bridget Carey of cnet does an excellent job of <a href="http://www.cnet.com/videos/what-is-net-neutrality-an-explanation-even-a-kid-can-understand/">explaining these types of deals</a> in the nerdiest way possible.</p>

<p>Freedom of expression and information are part of the foundation upon which this country was built. But after the Wiki-Leaks fiasco I'm sure some government officials would love to block certain information from ever going live. I mean, just look at China. The list of websites that the government has blocked from its citizens is insane. The list includes all Google websites and services, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Dropbox, and so much more. Those are services that I and so many others use every day.</p>

<p>Too bad that's not for much longer. Thankfully we have <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/hillary-clinton-talks-net-neutrality-philanthropy-in-tech-at-dreamforce-2014/">this to look forward to</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully.</p>

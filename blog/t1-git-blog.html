      Hi Folks! I thought I'd share some things I've learned in my first week of DBC Phase 0. Mainly this first week was about getting acclimated to the program and becoming familiar with version control software (VCS), which in our case was going in depth with Git and GitHub.
    </p>
    <p>
        VCS allows us to keep track of all changes and edits one makes to a piece of data. If a code ever breaks, we can go back to any previously saved iteration of that code. Git allows us to add and commit our data to a staging area in an organized fashion. Git also forces us to name each "commit" so that we know exactly what was modified. Performing a commit is like taking a snapshot of your work.
    </p>
    <p>
       GitHub lives online, whereas git just lives locally on your computer. We are using GitHub for various reasons. For one it is the most widely used, so we have access to a gigantic pool of information. We store our information in GitHub so that our code can be accessed by anyone in the world at anytime. This is extremely useful for all businesses and for anyone who is working in a group or team, because changes can be made and pushed by any person anywhere.
    <p>
      I'm learning so much more than I ever thought possible in just the first week of Phase 0. I can't wait to see what comes next!

      | After spending weeks learning Ruby, the transition to JavaScript has not been easy for me. It is taking me while to get used to the syntax, and the error messages are usually not helpful whatsoever. I have also found the text &#8220;Elegant Java Script&#8221; to be quite confusing. This is just a personal issue with me because almost every explanation and example in the book is related to math and/or numbers. I am not good at math, nor do I have a mathematical mind. Whenever coding concepts are related to numbers, it usually isn&#8217;t helpful to me. I have found that when I first begin to learn a language, it needs to be related to something tangible that I can clearly picture in my mind. Otherwise, whatever concept I am trying to learn doesn&#8217;t stick. This is why in addition to reading &#8220;Elegant JavaScript,&#8221; I am going through Code Academy&#8217;s JavaScript courses. I find their interactive lessons to be much more beneficial to my education rather than reading something that is difficult for me to grasp and understand. With my learning style, I learn best by doing and experimenting.
    p
      | Based on Ruby and JS concepts I have learned so far, I have noticed several similarities and differences between the two languages. For example, the Boolean operators &#38;&#38;, ||,
    p
      | The difference lies in the Ruby Boolean operators `==` and `!=`, and the JavaScript Boolean operators ==, !=, ===, and !==. JavaScript has these extra two operators to mean &#8220;precisely equal&#8221; (===) and &#8220;not precisely equal&#8221; (!==). These operators are included in part because of Automatic Type Conversion, also known as Type Coercion, which is a feature built into JavaScript. Let&#8217;s say you had the following statement in JavaScript:
    pre.
                      “5” == 5
                      //->true

    p
      | Wait what? Why is the return value true?! Now in Ruby, that would obviously return false because the string &#8220;5&#8221; is not equal to the integer 5. But in JavaScript, because of Type Coercion, the string &#8220;5&#8221; will be automatically turned into the integer 5 to make JS happy, thus returning true. But we do not want this. When we typed &#8220;5&#8221; we meant the string &#8220;5&#8221;, so the return value should be false. So to fix this, we need our new handy Boolean operators `===` and `!==` to tell JavaScript &#8220;NO! I do not want you to mess with by code. BACK OFF.&#8221; So now if we write
    pre.
                      “5” === 5
                      //->false

    p
      | our return value is false because &#8220;5&#8221; does not &#8220;precisely equal&#8221; 5. So when in doubt, use === (precisely equal) and !== (not precisely equal) rather than == and != to compare statements in JavaScript.

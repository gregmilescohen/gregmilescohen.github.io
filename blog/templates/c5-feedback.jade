      | I have found pairing sessions to be extremely helpful in multiple ways. However, there have been situations in which pair coding was not beneficial to my education. Pair coding has been most helpful when both my pair and I are really comfortable with the material, we have a great echange of ideas and our thought processes, and are able to breeze through the challenge. Pairing is also helpful when either my pair has a better understanding of the concepts we are working with so that he or she can help me understand them better, or vice versa so that I can help my pair out, which in turn helps me understand the concept even better.

      | There have been rare instances where my pair is lacking in communication, which can be frustrating. It could be that either they are ahead of me in programming knowledge and are not willing or do not have the patience to explain things to me, or if I am trying to explain something to them and they do not have the patience to listen. I feel that in pairing sessions like this, it would be more helpful to me if I were to complete the challenge on my own.

      | I have the most fun during pairing sessions when my pair and I are on the same page and clicking on all cylinders. We listen to each other, pick the other up if/when they are struggling, have a constant flow of ideas (no long periods without communication), and genrally enjoy working with the other person. I find that this is how most of my pairing sessions have been.

      | I won"t lie it can sometimes be hard to not take negative feedback personally, but I do my best to remember that it will only help to make me a better person and a better developer. It makes me think about changing things that I would not have though of otherwise. Luckily, most of my feedback has been really positive. The one thing it seems that I need to work on is to turn my personality down a few notches when I am pair coding on material that I am really comfortable with. I need to make sure there is a more even flow of communication so that I am not speaking over my pair. I am a passionate person, so I need to learn to control that a little better.

      | I find that writing feedback can be difficult when you truly enjoyed the session. I think it"s just human nature to have a lot to say when you dislike something. In my case, most of my pairing sessions have been great so I have had to take the time to really dissect the challenge in my head to be able to write feedback that is actionable, specific, and kind. Writing good "ASK" feedback is definitely something I can get better at.
    p
      | So after 5 weeks of DBC phase 0 I can say that pair coding and feedback have been extremely helpful to my education thus far. It brings a solid sense of community to an online education that would otherwise feel very isolated. I think they should be implemented into every online curriculum, as it provides a much better experience.

    <h1>Thoughts About Thinking Styles</h1>
    <h4>1.29.2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>After taking the <a href ="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">personal thinking style quiz</a>, apparently I am a "concrete random" thinker. This means that I like to take risks, I solve problems independently, I learn best when competing with others, and it's really hard for me to have a formal routine. Some of those things I would agree with, but some I wouldn't. I'll be honest I hate these types of personality quizes. For me at least, they are wildly innacurate because I'll never answer a personal quiz the same way twice. It really depends how I'm feeling that day. I think there are qualities from all four <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">mind styles</a> that apply to me. For the sake of this blog, I'll only comment on the learning style traits that are applicable to me within the concrete random "mind style."</p>

    <p>It is true that I do like to solve problems independently sometimes. I do feel that some tasks are best suited to be done on my own. Working in a group when you're not confident in the material can end up being a crutch and a hinderance to your learning, because you are always relying on other individuals for information. I think working alone and in groups needs to be a balance. It can also be really effective for me to learn by experimenting on my own, while using my intuition, to find answers. I am not afraid to fail while experimenting. Each failure brings me closer to a solution.</p>

    <p>Regardless of what one's thinking style is, I believe it is necessary to have a <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">growth mindset</a> to learn effectively. Having a growth mindset having the ability to means take on difficult challenges, show resilience, and learn from failures. Personally, I think I need to be better at taking critisism. I can sometimes have a knee-jerk reaction and take things personally. I need to analyze the information provided to me and use it to get better at whatever it is I'm doing. In general I believe I've displayed willpower, grit, and adaptability to new learning environments to get to where I am.</p>
